# Knight-Tour-Problem
 The knight tour problem, at least in its original inception, is a search problem whose path cost is of no interest in terms of cost minimization. Unlike the Traveling Salesman, the knight tour problem has no associated path cost to minimize. Any sequence of NxN moves that reaches a goal state is a perfectly valid solution. In other words, only the final state counts when performing the goal test. Solutions, if they exist, must reside necessarily at the last level of the search tree. Moreover, this result is independent of any formulation strategy used to abstract the problem.
